    <h1>About My Website</h1>
    <p>
      Hello! I’m Victor Mwendwa, a passionate software engineer with a strong
      foundation in developing innovative solutions that enhance user
      experiences. I specialize in web development, mobile application
      development, data analysis, among other services. I am currently pursuing
      a degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering at Technical University
      of Mombasa and a short course in full-stack software development at
      Moringa School. My proficiency in languages such as HTML, CSS and
      JavaScript allows me to tackle complex problems and deliver high-quality
      software. I thrive in collaborative environments and enjoy working with
      cross-functional teams to turn ideas into reality. I’m always eager to
      learn new technologies and methodologies to stay ahead in this rapidly
      evolving field. When I’m not coding, you can find me reading novels or
      playing video games. I believe in continuous growth and am always looking
      for ways to improve my skills and knowledge. Feel free to reach out if
      you’d like to connect or discuss potential collaborations!
